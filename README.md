# Anno 1503 - Widescreen Patch

## Installation

1. backup AnnoFrame.dll, and Texte.dat to a separate directory
2. copy and overwrite the files from one of the subdirectories to the main
   Anno installation directory

Activate the new resolution in the settings. The main menu will always be small,
and the new resolution will be visible after starting a game.

It is not possible to install multiple new resolutions at the same time. Also,
the game cannot handle higher resolutions than 1600x900.


## Anno version

The modified files are based on the European KÃ¶nigsedition. It might work with
other versions as well (e.g. GOG).


## Important

The game has always been quite buggy and unstable, and the patch will probably
make it worse. So remember to save often!

It is possible that the game lags, hangs, or even crashes when trying to start
a new game after ending a game and returning to the main menu. In that case
it is safer to restart Anno. Save-loading from inside the game is unaffected.
